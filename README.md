## Description
This project forecasts **hourly energy consumption** using **ARIMA** and **SARIMA** time series models. It highlights how **seasonality** affects predictions and why ARIMA alone may give flat forecasts for hourly data.  

---

## Features
- Preprocesses and cleans hourly energy data.
- Visualizes historical consumption trends.
- Fits **ARIMA** and **SARIMA** models for forecasting.
- Provides **hourly and daily forecasts**.
- Compare forecasts to demonstrate **seasonality impact**.
- Query forecasted energy for any **specific datetime**.
